The goal of W3405 is to help students improve their grammar and perfect their writing and reading skills, especially as a preparation for taking literature or civilization courses, or spending a semester in a francophone country. Through the study of two full-length works of literature and a number of short texts representative of different genres, periods, and styles, they will become more aware of stylistic nuances, and will be introduced to the vocabulary and methods of literary analysis. Working on the advanced grammar points covered in this course will further strengthen their mastery of French syntax. They will also be practicing writing through a variety of exercises, including pastiches and creative pieces, as well as typically French forms of academic writing such as &ldquo;r&eacute;sum&eacute;,&rdquo; &ldquo;explication de texte,&rdquo; and &ldquo;dissertation".

Today they are the subject of a passionate political struggle. This course examines the thinking about capitalism and freedom from the classical liberals, including Locke, Smith and Tocqueville, through to today&rsquo;s conservative movement and its opponents. Readings contrast selections from the &ldquo;conservative cannon,&rdquo; including Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, with several liberal or progressive counterparts. We will read Barbara Ehrenreich, Nickel and Dimed; Michael Lewis, Liar&rsquo;s Poker; and conclude by examining the landmark Supreme Court case, Citizens United.

In the former, the fundamental models of international trade theory will be presented. Using these models we will try to understand why countries specialize and trade, what determines the pattern of trade (i.e., which country will export which good), and how trade affects relative prices, welfare, and income distribution within a country. The second part of the course deals with issues concerning trade policy.&nbsp; We will compare the effects of and rationale behind the usage of various policy instruments such as tariffs, subsidies, quotas, etc. The political economy of trade policy and trade policy in developing countries will also be covered. Additional topics may be included at a later stage if time permits.

We will consider how the interplay of political and economic factors has been crucial in determining Africa''s place in a globalizing world. Our analysis will adopt a historical perspective and will include the politics of both domestic and international economic relations. It will explore four areas, namely the structure and evolution of the African economy, the role and impact of the major international economic institutions and aid agencies, the significance of the international asymmetry of power (using Uruguay and Doha Trade negotiations as case material) and finally the role of Africa''s political leadership.

Differing views of the relationship of humans to the environment are discussed and debated, and the impact of ethical systems on environmental policy and practices are described and analyzed. Environmental values, perceptions, norms, and behaviors are studied and analyzed. Environmental justice and the impact of racism on environmental outcomes are discussed in detail. The course also discusses the environmental policy and management process from the standpoint of ethics, as distinct from efficiency, effectiveness, expertise, cost, or other organizational considerations. Attempts are made to discover some guidelines for ethical stewardship of the planet and for formulating policy decisions with ethical considerations factored in.

Making markets work for the poor requires an understanding of social entrepreneurship and social enterprises in the developing world as strategies and untapped opportunities to add value to society by harnessing market forces that blend human, financial and social capital resources to achieve replicability and scale in every development domain, such as mobile health technologies, microfinance, renewable energy, water, education, fair trade, and agriculture. This course adopts both theoretical and applied cases, team-based field experiments and distinguished guest speakers in the teaching process to ensure that students gain an understanding of their roles as change makers and social entrepreneurs, and feel equipped to handle the complexities involved in designing hybrid models for efficient service delivery to the world''s poor (i.e., through public spending, development assistance, philanthropy and private or social sector "impact" investments).

Students learn how to formulate and design policy questions amenable to empirical inquiry, as well as how to identify and apply specific measurement and analytic methods appropriate to particular questions. Students are also introduced to the foundations of systems analysis: how to model and understand the design, operation, and impact of a system. The course begins with a discussion of the formulation of policy questions, the collection and organization of data, and the analysis and presentation of facts. Basic concepts of measures of central tendency, descriptive quantitative measures, and advanced inferential statistical techniques are covered. These techniques include multiple regression, time series and factor analysis, as well as the organization and presentation of advanced statistical analyses. Students are introduced to the use of computer-based data analysis and the rudimentary modeling of systems. Early in the fall semester, the class is divided into several groups to work on specific earth systems policy problems. The groups draw samples, design survey instruments, conduct surveys, code, clean, set up, and analyze data. They also write and present analytic reports, as the course places a heavy emphasis on presenting information to decision-makers.

The course will provide students with an introduction to quantitative models that can aid in the decision making process. The course utilizes the Excel spreadsheet with Precision Tree add-in for decision tree analysis plus @RISK and RiskOptimizer simulation software add-ins for evaluating risk. These software add-ins address the challenge posed by key decision making variables not being discrete or known with precision. Most business decisions are stochastic in nature where future values for key variables are not known with precision, but can be estimated with a probability distribution.

We assess a wide variety of terrorist organizations, and explore the psychological, socioeconomic, political, and religious causes of terrorist violence past and present. We also analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various counterterrorism strategies, from the point of view of efficacy as well as ethics, and look into ways in which the new threat of global terrorism might impact the healthy functioning of democratic states. The course is divided into two parts. Part I focuses on the terrorist threat, including the nature, roots, objectives, tactics, and organization of terrorism and terrorist groups. Part II addresses the issue of counterterrorism, including recent American efforts to combat terrorism, the strengths and weaknesses of counterterrorist tools and instruments, the issue of civil liberties and democratic values in confronting terrorism, and international strategies and tactics.

We''ll be listening to six operas in their entirety: Claude Debussy''s P&eacute;lleas et M&eacute;lisande, Alban Berg''s Wozzeck, Igor Stravinsky''s Oedipus Rex and The Rake''s Progress, Benjamin Britten''s The Turn of the Screw, and John Adams'' Nixon in China.

Specific topics include: urbanization, migration and settlement patterns; racial liberalism and political incorporation; critical engagement with East Harlem as research cite for "culture of poverty" theorists; state criminalization of youth; underground, illegal and illicit economy from the 1960s to the 1990s; struggles over property and gentrification; and perhaps most importantly, exploring Harlem as cultural and political center of the Black World throughout the twentieth century.

New issues for public health indicate a growing need for applied research, and social science research has become particularly important in the field of health promotion and in policy formation, evaluation and outcomes measurement. As a consequence, developing research agendas and undertaking research proposal assessment is becoming an important aspect of many health professionals'' work. Principal research design concerns included in the course are: selecting a research topic; developing and clarifying specific research aims and purposes; selecting populations or target groups to be involved in the research; identifying audiences; assessing resources; nominating research outcomes and applications; project planning and data management; dissemination of findings. Key issues discussed include: capacities and objectives of qualitative social research; multi-method research; and the relationship between difficult health problems and feasible research projects, including collaboration with affected communities. Students&nbsp; begin to develop their own research proposals during the course in preparation for subsequent intensive methods training in the second course in the sequence - P8786 Ethnographic Methods in Health Research.&nbsp; The course utilizes case studies in qualitative research, particularly from the HIV/AIDS, sexual health and related fields. .

Special attention will be given to the artistic legacies of Robert Smithson. With Al Gore''s An Inconvenient Truth (2006) as an important though problematic point of reference, the second half of the course will be devoted specifically to the ways in which artists, designers, and writers have responded to the planetary crisis of climate change. Overall, the class will ask how this crisis demands a radical rethinking of the role of the arts and humanities within both university research and the public sphere.

This course discusses how to allocate capital to projects within a firm in order to maximize the value of the firm to its shareholders. We describe how an investment project can be characterized by its cash flow profile, i.e., the amount and timing of costs and benefits of this project in the planning horizon. We show how firms should take into account the cost of capital, budgets, taxes, depreciation, inflation, and uncertainty, in order to decide which projects to undertake, reject, or postpone. This course is a good preparation for positions in investment banking, consulting, private equity, venture capital, corporate finance, and construction management, and for entrepreneurs. Students can take only one of IEOR E4003 and IEOR E4403, but not both.

This class is an introduction to the fundamental methods used in deterministic operations research. Topics covered will include linear programming, network flows, dynamic programming, and nonlinear programming. While we shall discuss the underlying theory with some occasional proofs, the emphasis will be on modeling. Applications of these ideas in various settings will be discussed. Students will learn modeling skills, and develop the ability to build, analyze, and reason logically with models. They will also learn to design and analyze algorithms, and to distinguish good algorithms from not-so good ones. They will also appreciate the capabilities and limitations of deterministic models in operations research.

This is also required for students in the Undergraduate Advanced Track. This course introduces students to operations research and stochastic processes. Operations research is concerned with quantitative decision problems, generally involving the allocation and control of limited resources, often in the presence of significant uncertainty. Stochastic processes are collections of random variables, usually indexed by time. [In stochastic process models, time can be regarded as either discrete or continuous.] For example, we might use stochastic processes to model the evolution of a stock price over time, the damage claims received by an insurance company over time, the work-in-process inventory in a factory over time or the number of calls waiting in a telephone call center over time, all of which evolve with considerable uncertainty. Among the stochastic processes to be considered are discrete-time Markov chains, random walks, continuous-time Markov chains, Poisson processes, birth-and-death processes, renewal processes, renewal-reward processes, Brownian motion and geometric Brownian motion. Among the engineering applications to be considered are queuing, inventory and finance.

This course covers modern methods for quality control and improvement: Statistical Process Control, introduction to Acceptance Sampling, and the relationships between quality and productivity. Since the invention of modern process control by Dr. Walter Shewhart in 1924, the field has been evolving. The recognition that management plays a major role in achieving quality has required an understanding of their part in achieving quality. The course examines the relationship of contemporary methods for product and process design, production, and delivery of products and services. We will introduce elements of latest concepts of Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma, and ISO 9000-2008. The course discusses the methods and tools used to manage processes to achieve highest quality at lowest cost. We cover the interaction of management methods and quality productivity. The course covers methods used in manufacturing, as well as service industries such as finance, healthcare, etc.

In addition to the classroom requirements, students will be expected to volunteer a minimum of 4 hours a week with the Double Discovery Center (DDC), in connection to the Freedom and Citizenship Project which DDC conducts in partnership with the American Studies Program.

This seminar is an introduction to the theory and methods that have been developed by anthropologists to study contemporary cities and urban cultures. Although anthropology has historically focused on the study of non-Western and largely rural societies, since the 1960s anthropologists have increasingly directed attention to cities and urban cultures. During the course of the semester, we will examine such topics as: the politics of urban planning, development and land use; race, class, gender and urban inequality; urban migration and transnational communities; the symbolic economies of urban space; and, street life. Reading will include the work of Jane Jacobs, Sharon Zukin, and Henri Lefebvre.

African Americans have been both contributors to, and victims of, this &ldquo;New World&rdquo; democratic experiment. To capture the complexities of this ongoing saga, this course offers an inter-disciplinary exploration of the development of African American cultural and political life in the U.S., but also in relationship to the different African diasporic outposts of the Atlantic world. The course will be organized both chronologically and thematically, moving from the &ldquo;middle passage&rdquo; to the present so-called &ldquo;post-racial&rdquo; moment&mdash;drawing on a range of classical texts, primary sources, and more recent secondary literature&mdash;to grapple with key questions, concerns and problems (i.e. agency, resistance, culture, structure, etc.) that have preoccupied scholars of African American history, culture and politics. &nbsp; Students will be introduced to range of disciplinary methods and theoretical approaches (spanning the humanities and social sciences), while also attending to the critical tension between intellectual work and everyday life, which are central to the formation of African-American Studies as an academic field. This course will engage specific social formations (i.e. migration, urbanization, globalization, diaspora, etc), significant cultural/political developments (i.e. uplift ideologies, nationalism, feminism, pan-Africanism, religion/spirituality, etc), and hallmark moments/movements (i.e. Harlem Renaissance, Civil Rights movement, Black Power, etc). By the end of the semester students will be expected to possess a working knowledge of major themes/figures/traditions, alongside a range of cultural/political practices and institutional arrangements, in African American Studies.

Open to students in M.A. in Biotechnology Program (points can be counted against laboratory requirement for that program), Ph.D. and advanced undergraduate students with background in genetics or molecular biology. Students should be comfortable with basic biotechnology laboratory techniques as well as being interested in doing computational work in a Windows environment. This course deals with the proteome: the expressed protein complement of a cell, matrix, tissue, organ or organism. The study of the proteome (proteomics) is broadly applicable to life sciences research, and is increasing important in academic, government and industrial research through extension of the impact of advances in genomics. These techniques are being applied to basic research, exploratory studies of cancer and other diseases, drug discovery and many other topics. Techniques of protein extraction, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry will be covered. Emphasis will be on mastery of practical techniques of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and database searching for identification of proteins separated by gel electrophoresis as well as background tutorials and exercises covering other techniques used in descriptive and comparative proteomics. Lab Fee: $150.

Students wishing to cover the full range of modern biochemistry should take both BIOC C3501 and C3512. C3501 covers subject matters in modern biochemistry, including chemical biology and structural biology, discussing the structure and function of both proteins and small molecules in biological systems. Proteins are the primary class of biological macromolecules and serve to carry out most cellular functions. Small organic molecules function in energy production and creating building blocks for the components of cells and can also be used to perturb the functions of proteins directly. The first half of the course covers protein structure, enzyme kinetics and enzyme mechanism. The second half of the course explores how small molecules are used endogenously by living systems in metabolic and catabolic pathways; this part of the course focuses on mechanistic organic chemistry involved in metabolic pathways.

The course is intended for those who have developed basic speaking and listening skills through exposure to Hebrew at home or in day-school programs but do not use Hebrew as their dominant language and have not reached the level required for exemption from the Columbia language requirement. Heritage speakers differ in the degree of their fluency, but their vocabulary is often limited to topics in daily life and many lack skills in reading and writing to match their ability to converse. The course focuses on grammar and vocabulary enrichment, exposing students to a variety of cultural and social topics in daily life and beyond. By the end of the semester students are able to read and discuss simple texts and write about a variety of topics. Successful completion of the year-long sequence prepares students to enroll in third-year modern Hebrew.

It looks at the main ways those questions have been answered, exploring debates both in Western academic scholarship and among scholars and intellectuals in the region itself. For each question, the course offers new ways of thinking about the issue or ways of framing it in different terms. The topics covered in the course include: the kinds of modern state that emerged in the Middle East and the ways its forms of power and authority were shaped; the birth of economic development as a way of describing the function and measuring the success of the state, and the changing metrics of this success; the influence of oil on the politics of the region; the nature and role of Islamic political movements; the transformation of the countryside and the city and the role of rural populations and of urban protest in modern politics; and the politics of armed force and political violence in the region, and the ways in which this has been understood. The focus of the course will be on the politics of the twentieth century, but many topics will be traced back into developments that occurred in earlier periods, and several will be explored up to the present. The course is divided into four parts, each ending with a paper or exam in which participants are asked to analyze the material covered. Each part of the course has a geographical focus on a country or group of countries and a thematic focus on a particular set of questions of historical and political analysis.

In the United States, latino/as are building on decades of organizing and demographic growth to claim a new public persona and challenge their marginal status. What are the significant areas of political action, and how can we understand them? What claims can those disenfranchised for reasons of race, class or national origin make on societies? Indigenous survival movements in Brazil, multi-ethnic electoral alliances in Bolivia, growing Afro-Colombian assertion, Dominican community organizing in New York City, and poetic post-marxist guerrillas in Mexico are just a few of the new forms of social activism that are transforming class, ethnic identity and citizenship throughout the Americas, and combating the dominance of free-market social and economic policies. We will discuss a number of important social movements throughout the region, while developing tools for understanding social movements and their possibilities. This class is designed to give you an opportunity to do independent research; as a result, it will demand your intensive engagement, and your willingness both to master the information and tools we go over in class, and to pursue a specific topic of your own choosing. You will all write a term paper based on independent research.

International topics include the standard international business cycle setup, its calibration and main results; international risk-sharing; trade puzzles; and measurement issues. We will also cover individual decision making models in which individuals respond to income fluctuations under complete and incomplete markets, under full and asymmetric information.

The course will survey the Korean peninsula''s modern history from Japanese colonialism, partition and the establishment of two separate Koreas, Cold War politics, the Korean War, and South Korea''s democracy movement to the present-day North Korean nuclear crisis. Since the division of the Korean peninsula in 1945, South Korea has developed into one of the largest trading nations in the world with a vibrant democratic polity. North Korea, isolated, destitute, and now ruled by a third-generation hereditary dictatorship, has descended into a perpetually aid-dependent state that maintains internal control through extreme repression. What does the future hold for the two Koreas? Special attention will be given to the North''s strategy of brinkmanship, the implications of possible regime collapse, and an analysis of U.S. North Korea policy.

Shaw, Willa Cather, Ralph Ellison, Gerald Early, Lester Bangs, Ellen Willis (music); Eric Bentley, Mary McCarthy, C.L.R.

This term is invariably (and incorrectly) interpreted as an unchanging legal code dating back to 7th century Arabia. In reality, Islamic law is an organic and constantly evolving human project aimed at ascertaining God''s will in a given historical and cultural context. This course offers a detailed and nuanced look at the Islamic legal methodology and its evolution over the last 1400 years. The first part of the semester is dedicated to classical Islamic jurisprudence, concentrating on the manner in which jurists used the Qur''an, the Sunna (the model of the Prophet), and rationality to articulate a coherent legal system. The second part of the course focuses on those areas of the law that engender passionate debate and controversy in the contemporary world. Specifically, we examine the discourse surrounding Islamic family (medical ethics, marriage, divorce, women''s rights) and criminal (capital punishment, apostasy, suicide/martyrdom) law. The course concludes by discussing the legal implications of Muslims living as minorities in non-Islamic countries and the effects of modernity on the foundations of Islamic jurisprudence.

I will begin with a relatively brief review of the techniques of financial appraisal (i.e. cash flow analysis) of projects, since similar techniques are used in most cost-benefit analysis exercises. However, while a financial analyst for a private, profit--making entity focuses only on the net cashflows the entity receives from a project, the cost-benefit analyst has to consider a proposal''s economic costs and benefits from a societal perspective. This course should be most directly relevant for those who intend to pursue careers in the public sector as analysts/applied economists with governmental agencies, public authorities, multilateral institutions, or research institutes/think-tanks.

The first half of the course is devoted to discussing readings in the history of translation theory while translating brief practical exercises; in the second half, translation projects are submitted to the class for critical discussion. The foreign texts for these projects, chosen in consultation with the instructor, will be humanistic, not only literature as conventionally defined (prose fiction and poetry, memoir and travel writing), but also the gamut of text types in the human sciences, including philosophy, history, and ethnography. The aim is not just to translate, but to think deeply about translating, to develop writing practices by drawing on the resources of theory, past and present, and by examining translations written by professionals.  Enrollment in this workshop is limited to 12 students. Admission into the class is by permission of the instructor. CPLT BC 3011 "Introduction to Translation Studies" is a recommended prerequisite, plus, normally, two advanced courses beyond the language requirement in the language from which you intend to translate. Preference will be given to seniors and to comparative literature majors.  Please submit an application to pconnor@barnard.edu by 30 November 2012 with the following information: your name, year of graduation, and major; a list of courses you have taken in the language from which you intend to translate; any other pertinent courses you have taken; any further relevant information relating to your language ability; a brief (max 300 word) explanation of why you wish to take this workshop. You will be notified of admission by 18 December.   N.B. This course cannot be substituted for the required Senior Seminar CPLS BC3997

Corruption impedes human rights, sustainable development and humanitarian aid, in addition to the rule of law and the administration of justice. Effective management requires an understanding of soft or relational corruption, including narcissistic leadership, prejudicial culture, complicit loyalty and impassive technocracy. It also requires an understanding of hard, or material corruption, including bribery and gift-giving; evident conflict of interest, such as self-dealt compensation and investment, besides nepotism, cronyism and favoritism; and latent conflict of interest, such as campaign contributions, voter suasion and lobbyist support, in exchange for regulatory loopholes, waivers, earmarks, bailouts, subsidies, permits and contracts, besides perquisites such as honoraria, board directorships and revolving-door career advancements. Expectations for the quality of civil discourse and the integrity of civil society are examined, as are appropriate anti-corruption measures. These include soft measures such as transparency and inclusivity and hard measures such as financial disclosure and whistle-blower protections. The course aims to model the public leader, using ethical building blocks of sensitivity and rationality, among them empathy and authenticity. Local, national and international cases are analyzed to determine how a public leader can remediate corrupt practices to achieve ethical decision making outcomes. (Spring semester only)

In July and August, an unprecedented volume of Shakespeareï¿½s plays will be performed in the City, at the center of which is the Royal Shakespeare Company''s unprecedented five-play engagement at the Park Avenue Armory in collaboration with the Lincoln Center Festival and The Ohio State University. In this course, we will read, discuss, and together attend all five of the RSC''s productions: As You Like It, Romeo and Juliet, Winter''s Tale, Julius Caesar, and King Lear.

Do we have basic duties that are owed equally to human beings everywhere, regardless of national or political affiliation? Do our commitments to co-nationals or compatriots conflict with those duties we might owe to others, and if so, to what extent? Is cosmopolitanism based on rationality and patriotism based on passion? This course will explore these questions from the perspectives of nationalism, republicanism and cosmopolitanism. We will consider historical works from Herder, Rousseau, Kant, Fichte, Mill, Mazzini and Renan; and more contemporary contributions from Berlin, Miller, Canovan, MacIntyre, Viroli, Sandel, Pettit, Habermas, Nussbaum, Appiah, and Pogge, among others.

What kind of economic world could we expect to find? One in which the common good would be attained by market forces, or one in which many would be left behind? This course uses a diversity of sources to examine the interplay of culture, ethics and economics. The starting point is Adam Smith''s work. Economists and policy makers have focused on one side of Adam Smith''s work represented by self-regarding behavior and the supremacy of the invisible hand in market functioning. However, Adam Smith also pointed out that one of humans'' central emotions is "sympathy", a natural tendency to care about the well-being of others. In light of the recent events as well as research this other side of Adam Smith''s work appears now more relevant. We analyze evidence of cooperative versus self-regarding behaviors and its relationship with the economy, human evolution and cultural values in a variety of settings. Readings include works from Adam Smith, Milton Freedman, Charles Dickens, David Rockefeller and Chris Gardner.

We will consider the ways public education reproduces as well as challenges inequality and discuss its potential to provide skills and dispositions for democratic citizenship in our increasingly diverse society

It considers a wide range of visual media (photography, painting, sculpture), as well as aspects of visuality (surveillance, profiling). We will use case studies ranging in time from the early modern period (practices in which the body was marked to measure criminality, for example), to the present day. Within this framework, we will study how aspects of visual culture have been used to advocate for human rights, as well as how images and visual regimes have been used to suppress human rights. An important part of the course will be to consider the role played by reception in shaping a discourse around human rights, visuality, and images. Subjects to be addressed include: the nature of evidence; documentation and witness; censorship; iconoclasm; surveillance; profiling; advocacy images; signs on the body; visibility and invisibility.

Such balance is studied in three different stages: the foundation for human rights, the content of human rights, and the goals sought in drafting a body of human rights'' norms. In order to debate different concepts of equality and their connection to identity and difference, some core questions are explored: What type of equality are we looking for: complete equality of results, complete equality of opportunities, equal treatment, equality of respect, equal consideration of preferences, equality of resources, equality based on needs, equality of agency, equality of freedom? Is it equality for whom? Finally, the course discusses the rights of differently situated groups: national minorities, indigenous peoples, racial minorities, women, LGBT, persons with disabilities, children, and religious groups.

The course will address many of the central debates about economic and social rights and then examine how those debates apply to specific rights and topics including development, health, housing, work, food and education. Throughout, the course will examine how activists and policymakers have responded to all these changes, and ask what might lie ahead for the human rights movement in addressing economic and social rights in a multilateral, globalized world.

This course is an advance seminar in the field of human factors. A significant part of the course will explore methodologies and tools that facilitate the integration of psychological and human factor research in the design of new products and processes. The first part of the seminar will discuss methodological issues associated with human factor research and product evaluation. The second part of the seminary will address specific "user centered" methodologies (ISO, ANSI) that support the design process. The third part of the course will explore alternative product evaluation techniques. Students will be required to critique scientific research articles in class, and to perform a usability evaluation of a redesigned product. This is a seminar and therefore class participation is important. The opportunity to pursue individual interests in human factors (e.g. consumer, financial and medical product design, human computer interaction, stress, error analysis, usability evaluation, augmented cognition) is strongly encouraged.

Higgins. Commodities markets have been much in the public eye recently as volatility has increased and they changed from markets dominated by physical participants to ones which have a significant investor component. The largest banks either already have profitable commodities franchises already or are actively building them, and money managers and funds are increasingly including these assets in their portfolio mix. The end result is a dramatic increase in focus on these markets from all aspects of the financial markets, including the quantitative end.

We will examine key challenges facing African institutions and leaders including developing the tools for good governance, dealing with the illegal exploitation of natural resources, conflict resolution, protection of human rights, and strengthening humanitarian response (e.g. protection of women and children in conflict zones). African states have the potential to benefit from globalization but are also challenged by both old and new global trading patterns from which in many areas they are still marginalized. Recognizing and overcoming these constraints represents a major challenge for Africa''s leaders and civil society representatives as well as their external partners - the United Nations, the European Union, and major bilateral donors.

The focus is on how literature as a discipline works comparatively and how it borrows and differs from other disciplines in its forms of comparativism. Readings foreground moments when Greece''s position at the crossroads (between East and West, Byzantine and Ottoman, Ancient and Modern, the Balkans and Europe, Greece and America) become comparatively productive to particular fields (Comparative Literature, History, Sociology, Film, Architecture, Anthropology, Ethnic, Gender, and Translation Studies). The course can be taken with an extra-credit tutorial for students reading materials in the original and fulfills the Global core requirement.

Nearly 90 percent of these films belong to the Hindi language Indian popular cinema. Bombay cinema, or "Bollywood," is an exceptional industry, holding its own against Hollywood´s expansion into markets like India. This course provides a historical and thematic introduction to the wide panorama of Indian popular films that constitute an Indian national cinema. Starting with the period following independence in 1947, the course considers the cultural backgrounds of Hindi popular cinema. Moving through the decades, it explores the various genres within this cinema and their thematic concerns. Through the screening of 14 films and accompanying readings and class discussions, the course addresses questions like: What is the aesthetic appeal of Bombay cinema? How did Hindi language cinema assume the position of "national" cinema, both within the subcontinent and beyond? How do these "song and dance" movies challenge our commonplace perceptions of narrative forms? What role do phenomena like globalization, communalism, diaspora, neo-liberal economic policy, consumerism, and transnationalism play in the evolution of Hindi popular cinema and its genres over the decades? What are the origins and implications of the term "Bollywood"?

In addition, students work with an individual advisor who has expertise in the area of the thesis and can advise on the specifics of method and content. The thesis will be jointly evaluated by the adviser, the DUS, and the honors thesis TA. The DUS will lead students through a variety of exercises that are directly geared to facilitating the thesis. Students build their research, interpretive, and writing skills; discuss methodological approaches; write an annotated bibliography; learn to give constructive feedback to peers and respond to feedback effectively. The final product is a polished research paper in the range of 40-60 pages. Please note: This is a one-year course that begins in the fall semester (1 point) and continues through the spring semester (3 points). Only students who have completed both semesters will receive the full 4 points of credit.

Though its main purpose will be to provide students with an understanding of politics after independence, it will argue, methodologically, that this understanding should be based on a study of historical sociology – plotting long-terms shifts in the structure of social power.  The course will start with analyses of the structures of power and ideas about political legitimacy in pre-modern India, and the transformations brought by colonialism into that order. After a brief study of the nature of political order under the colonial state, the courses will focus primarily on the history of the democratic state after independence.

The goal of the three-pronged approach is to prepare students for understanding and exercising leadership-executive ability in government, non-governmental organizations, and business. Leadership is the ability to influence people towards achieving a goal. An important part of the SIPA mission is to prepare students for leadership and innovative policy making. In this course we will examine leadership and policy making "out of the box" as well as "inside the box" by having students tackle several key themes and some specific questions. The themes include issues such as, are leaders born or made? What kind of leaders design and implement "good" versus "bad" policies? Can "nudging" and "innovative policy making" substitute for forceful policy intervention? To what extent are economic and political outcomes products of leadership as opposed to external environment?

This course is required for all undergraduate students majoring in IE, OR:EMS, OR:FE and OR. This class must be taken during (or before) the sixth semester. This course equips students with knowledge of fundamental issues in production and inventory planning and control in manufacturing firms while developing students'' modeling and analytical skills. The course is targeted toward engineering students planning careers in technical consulting, business analysis in operations, logistics, supply-chain and revenue-management functions, positions in general management and future entrepreneurs. The course will cover inventory management and production planning; material requirements planning; aggregate planning of production, inventory, and work force; multi-echelon integrated production-inventory systems; and production scheduling. Students will have an opportunity to participate in a computer-simulation game where, as operations managers for a company, they work in teams to manage capacity, inventories, scheduling, and purchasing of parts. The recitation section is required.

This course is designed to integrate material learned in other advanced IE and OR courses to improve the student''s understanding of the application of these advanced methods in increasing the performance of production and service systems. Emphasis is placed on the practical implementation of recommendations generated from the advanced modeling and system''s understanding gained in the full range of IE and OR fields. The intent is to strengthen the student''s management skills by applying the technical and theoretical IE and OR material provide throughout the curriculum to both production and service delivery systems equally. The basic approach taken is to study the important production and service delivery topics using the case study method, although the students will also demonstrate technical expertise with specific homework problem assignments as well. Each week students will present an analysis of key issues in an assigned case pertinent to the topic under consideration. Most case reports will be done in groups and presented in class discussion. The case studies describe the real operations of domestic or foreign companies. Students are expected to apply what they have learned thus far from the curriculum, especially those topics covered in E 4000 and/or E 3402, to address those topics raised in the cases. Class meetings are largely devoted to detailed case analysis and discussions. Motivated by the case studies, we may also introduce some new theory. The primary goal of the course is to allow students to see the applications of theories in a more realistic and intricate setting to gain a broader view of production and service management. Topics covered include Process Analysis, Forecasting, Capacity Planning, Queuing Systems, Inventory Management, Quality Management, Supply Chain Management, Just-In-Time Management and Process Re-engineering.

The socio-economic effects in all places affected by these disasters are still unfolding. Some seem to be deeply impacted while others have had relatively little lasting impact.

This course will prepare graduate students in political science and economics who have completed their basic formal and quantitative training for the challenges and appeals of interdisciplinary research in political economy. Substantively, the course will focus on interest groups and political influence, which remains one of the broad areas of interest within the field. The main activities of special interest groups include lobbying, campaign contributions, direct mobilization of citizens, and providing information to the public. Clearly all of them have political significance, and we will study both theoretically and empirically the most significant channels of influence on policies, sometimes through the influence on elected officials (before or after the election) and sometimes through influence on bureaucrats. The topic should be of clear relevance for graduate students in American politics, comparative politics, political economy and public economics, and should complement well the other courses available in those four fields.

Even though the content never changed, the mood always did: aggressive, mild, indifferent, lyrical, sensitive, technical, indirect, deceitful. If, as fiction writers, one of our pursuits is to stylize various forms of information, and to call the result a story or novel, it is also tempting, and easy, to adopt trends of style without realizing it, and to possibly presume we operate outside of stylistic restrictions and conventions. Some styles become so commonplace that they no longer seem stylistic. V.S. Naipaul remarked in an interview that he was opposed to style, yet we can''t exactly summarize his work based on its content. His manner of telling is sophisticated, subtle, shrewdly indirect, and elegant. He is, in short, a stylist. His brilliance might be to presume that this is the only way to tell a story, and to consider all other ways styles. This course for writers will look at a wide range of prose styles, from conspicuous to subtle ones. We will not only read examples of obviously stylistic prose, but consider as well how the reigning prose norms are themselves stylistic bulwarks, entrenched in the culture for various reasons that might interest us. One project we will undertake, in order to deepen our understanding and approach to style, will be to restylize certain of the passages we read. These short fiction exercises will supplement our weekly readings and will allow us to practice rhetorical tactics, to assess our own deep stylistic instincts, and to possibly dilate the range of locutions available to us as we work.

They may stand apart from the mainstream because of willful eccentricity, madness, even social disgrace, but in each case their alienation provides them with a unique perspective, one that allows the reader to see the world they describe without the dulling lens of convention. We will explore what authors might gain by narrating their works from an "outsider" viewpoint, and we will study how the peculiar form and structure of these books reflects the modernist impulse in literature. This is a seminar designed for fiction writers, so we will spend time talking about not only the artistic merits of these books, but also about how the authors, who include Dostoevsky, Knut Hamsun, Jean Rhys, Denis Johnson, Joy Williams, Samuel Beckett and Amos Tutuola, achieve their specific effects. Over the course of the semester, we will use these texts as a springboard for writing original fiction.
