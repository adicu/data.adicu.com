The course is divided into units that address these subjects in turn, and through which students will also acquire the fundamental vocabulary for the analysis of cultural objects. The course also stresses the acquisition of rhetorical skills with which to write effectively in Spanish about the topics discussed. This course is required for the major and the concentration in Hispanic Studies.

The course is structured in two parts. The first centers on the fundamental and technical aspects of the material. Students will learn construction techniques, glazing and finishing methods, and particulars about firing procedures. This part of the course will move quickly in order to expose the students to a variety of ceramic processes. Weekly assignments, demonstrations and lectures will be given. The second centers on the issue of how to integrate ceramics into the students'' current practice. Asking the question of why we use ceramics as a material and further, why we choose the materials we do to make art. Rigorous group and individual critiques focusing on the above questions will be held. The goal of this course is to supply the students with the knowledge and skill necessary to work in ceramics and enough proficiency and understanding of the material to enable them to successfully incorporate it into their practice.

We will start with the mathematical and computational analysis of small networks in order to understand some of the basic principles in biological networks including network motifs, modularity, robustness and stochasticity. The course will then scale up to much larger networks teaching the computation techniques needed to address these including Hidden Markov Models, Bayesian networks, FDR, Bootstrapping, Expectation Maximization, Inference, Gibbs Sampling, Monte Carlo and Belief Propagation. We cover many of the pitfalls of high throughput data and how to over come these, proper modeling choices when building large scale models of molecular networks and how to apply the techniques learned to real data. We will learn how to reconstruct regulatory networks from such data and understand how these networks compute, dynamically change and the connections between genetic sequence and these molecular regulatory networks. Finally will demonstrate how the Bayesian techniques learned in the course can be applied to other biological networks such as a network of interacting neurons.

Students wishing to cover the full range of modern biochemistry should take both BIOC C3501 and C3512. C3501 covers subject matters in modern biochemistry, including chemical biology and structural biology, discussing the structure and function of both proteins and small molecules in biological systems. Proteins are the primary class of biological macromolecules and serve to carry out most cellular functions. Small organic molecules function in energy production and creating building blocks for the components of cells and can also be used to perturb the functions of proteins directly. The first half of the course covers protein structure, enzyme kinetics and enzyme mechanism. The second half of the course explores how small molecules are used endogenously by living systems in metabolic and catabolic pathways; this part of the course focuses on mechanistic organic chemistry involved in metabolic pathways.

MU233	December 17					This course is designed as a supplement to the advanced theoretical and technical courses the Department offers in OR by providing the students with a thorough understanding of the art and science of the practical application of Operations Research to solving real-world problems of a wide variety. The purpose is to give them the understanding of how successful OR projects are undertaken and what obstacles are present to thwart success. Issues discussed range from the technical difficulties of applying OR to the personal/bureaucratic barriers to success. The course is designed to increase the ability of the students to put their OR education to work to enhance their careers. In addition it is designed to inspire the students'' creativity as well as draw out the deep knowledge of OR acquired in the other courses covering the theoretical and technical aspects of OR. The coursework consists mainly of a semester-long group project directed at one major problem for a client. Students form teams and select from a list of potential projects or design their own in cooperation with a client. At semester''s end, the student''s must make a presentation of their results and demonstrate their client''s reaction, preferably planned implementation. Classroom material consists of readings and videos of practical applications of OR, some successful some not. Students critique the readings and solve related problems for homework using the OR techniques they have learned in their advanced courses. Lectures by the professors organize the lessons about application techniques to provide general approaches for successful projects.

Fishler. The course is an introductory level course on the various aspects of Algorithmic and Quantitative Trading. The course will put significant emphasis on topics related to execution and to greater extent to quantitative trading. The course will put large emphasis on practical consideration in the general area of quantitative trading, and in particular in the equities world. Some of the topics that will be covered. Market participants, the mechanics of trading, order books, exchanges, ATS, ECNs, etc. Market micro structure, routing, rules, market impact, covariance matrix estimation in various time frames, dynamic and optimal trading, statistical arbitrage, portfolio optimization. The course homework will include working with data sets at various frequencies. &nbsp; Spring: Algorithmic Trading, taught by Professor I. Kani. Algorithmic trading refers to a large and amorphous collection of subjects ranging from the study of market microstructure, to the analysis of optimal trading strategies, to the development of computerized, high frequency trading strategies. Analysis of these subjects, the scientific and practical issues they involve, and the extensive body of academic literature they have spawned, are undoubtedly among the most challenging and exciting endeavors in the modern financial economics. In this course we will examine these and other related subjects in some detail, and attempt to uncover their economic and financial mechanism that drive and ultimately relate them.

In this second part of the historical survey, we will focus our attention on the politics of representation in twentieth century African American literature from Richard Wright''s first novel, Native Son (1940), to John Edgar Wideman''s seminal memoir, Brothers and Keepers (1984). How do we locate these texts within an appropriate historical and cultural context? What theories of representation best serve our needs as readers of race, gender, and class? Does it make sense to teach these works as a distinct literary tradition? Course requirements: mandatory class attendance and participation, two five-page essays, and final examination. Previous enrollment in Eng W3400X is not required.

Through close analysis of texts, poetry, narrative, travelogue and memoirs, it argues that the bane of modernity is its subordination to a Western ideal that minimizes or even negates its engagement with Islamic and Arab tradition. The nation state and through codification processes and as led by the intelligentsia forged a social program that is no less divested of tradition and rural culture. Only after 1967, the unsettling experience of total bankruptcy, that intellectuals question the dichotomies of science versus religion and the myth of progress versus tradition. New writings take to the street where they find substance and faith that has been ignored for long under cultural dependency. These works receive due attention in relation to theoretical studies that increase readers&rsquo; critical insight. PS. No prior knowledge of Arabic language is required.

What determines the success of ethnic insurgencies? Why do some civil wars last longer than others? Do international laws protect civilians during military conflict? How we go about answering these questions (and other important questions about politics and our world) determines the quality of our answers. This course is about evaluating the quality of answers to political and social science research questions, and introduces fundamental topics in research design, choice of method, and data analysis. Although the material introduces concepts that are relevant to both quantitative and qualitative research methods, this course emphasizes quantitative research and provides an introduction to basic statistical analysis. At the successful completion of the course, students will be well-prepared to conduct independent research, including senior honor theses.

This course will prepare graduate students in political science and economics who have completed their basic formal and quantitative training for the challenges and appeals of interdisciplinary research in political economy. Substantively, the course will focus on interest groups and political influence, which remains one of the broad areas of interest within the field. The main activities of special interest groups include lobbying, campaign contributions, direct mobilization of citizens, and providing information to the public. Clearly all of them have political significance, and we will study both theoretically and empirically the most significant channels of influence on policies, sometimes through the influence on elected officials (before or after the election) and sometimes through influence on bureaucrats. The topic should be of clear relevance for graduate students in American politics, comparative politics, political economy and public economics, and should complement well the other courses available in those four fields.

It plays an important role in the Human Rights Concentration as a means by which students are able to examine current trends in the human rights field and remain informed about the different roles that human rights actors play in a variety of contexts. The Practicum is designed, therefore, to enhance students'' abilities to think critically and analytically about current problems and challenges confronting the field, and to do so in the context of a vibrant community of their peers.

Students learn how to formulate and design policy questions amenable to empirical inquiry, as well as how to identify and apply specific measurement and analytic methods appropriate to particular questions. Students are also introduced to the foundations of systems analysis: how to model and understand the design, operation, and impact of a system. The course begins with a discussion of the formulation of policy questions, the collection and organization of data, and the analysis and presentation of facts. Basic concepts of measures of central tendency, descriptive quantitative measures, and advanced inferential statistical techniques are covered. These techniques include multiple regression, time series and factor analysis, as well as the organization and presentation of advanced statistical analyses. Students are introduced to the use of computer-based data analysis and the rudimentary modeling of systems. Early in the fall semester, the class is divided into several groups to work on specific earth systems policy problems. The groups draw samples, design survey instruments, conduct surveys, code, clean, set up, and analyze data. They also write and present analytic reports, as the course places a heavy emphasis on presenting information to decision-makers.
